Downloader for Springer textbooks released during COVID-19

**Springer Nature** [released](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/news-events/all-news-articles/industry-news-initiatives/free-access-to-textbooks-for-institutions-affected-by-coronaviru/17855960) approximately 400 textbooks (English and German language) for free download.  

I store my pdf's by author's name, last name first.  So `springer_downloader` will download pdf's and epub's to a folder on my J: drive, Springer, with subfolders for each author.  The code saves a copy for each co-author (but only downloads one copy), so if you have an alternate way of storing your files you could reduce the amount stored on your hard drive.

If you want to store it elsewhere, edit PWD in the constants section of the module.

I used this to download all the files... others have written their modules to only download certain subject areas; it should be easy to modify this code to do that.
