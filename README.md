Downloader for Springer textbooks released during COVID-19

**Springer Nature** [released](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/news-events/all-news-articles/industry-news-initiatives/free-access-to-textbooks-for-institutions-affected-by-coronaviru/17855960) approximately 400 textbooks (English and German language) for free download.  

I store my pdf's by author's name, last name first.  So `springer_downloader` will download pdf's and epub's to a folder on my J: drive, Springer, with subfolders for each author.

If you want to store it elsewhere, edit PWD in the constants section of the module.

I used this to download all the files... others have written their modules to only download certain subject areas; it should be easy to modify this code to do that.
